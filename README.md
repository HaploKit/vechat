Haplotype-aware error correction for noisy long reads using variation graphs. Noisy variation graphs are constructed from raw long reads, preserving true [v]()ariations and sequencing [e]()rrors. This graph could be then pruned based on the correlations([chat]()) between nodes (i.e. variations or errors). The pruned variation graphs are subsequently used to perform haplotype-aware error correction.

Error self-correction is usually the first step and thus crucial in long-read sequencing data analysis. Current methods generally perform self-correction by computing a consensus sequence for each read, which may lose haplotype-specific variations in  heterogeneous genomes such as polyploid genomes and metagenomes. Here, we present vechat, a novel approach to perform haplotype-aware error correction for noisy long reads. Benchmarking results on both simulated and real data indicate that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy. Additionally, integrating vechat with long-read assemblers significantly improves haplotype-aware genome assembly.
