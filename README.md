# vechat
Haplotype-aware error correction for noisy long reads using variation graphs. Noisy variation graphs are constructed from raw long reads, preserving true $\underline{X}$ *v*ariations and sequencing *e*rrors. The graph could be then pruned based on the correlations(*chat*) between variations and errors.
